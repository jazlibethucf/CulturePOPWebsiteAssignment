        <!-- History paragraph -->
        <p> The POP Art movement was an art movement that began in ths created work that was inspired by the world around them which involved movies, advertisements, poe 1950's and lasted until the late 1960's early 1970's in American and Great Britain. Several well known artists contributed to this movement including Andy Warhol (whose work can be seen above) and Yayoi Kusama. This movement began as a result of young artists being taught in art school the way art is traditonally created and how it 'should' look. This resulted in those young artistp music, comic books and product packaging. One of the characteristics of Pop art includes imagery that is recognizeable such as brands, celebrities, or other logos in the media. Another characteristic of Pop art is innovative techniques to making art that are viewed as nontradiitonal such as printmaking which enabled artists to produce images in large quantitied. Andy Warhol is famous for this printmaking techniques and repetitive imagery as seen in his work above called Marilyn.

        <!-- Yayoi Kusama exlcusive paragraph -->
        <p> A spreviously mentioned, Yayoi Kusama is a well known artist who heavily contributed to the Pop art movement in the 1960's. At the time being a single Japanese woman resulted in her facing racism, sexism and a lack of recognition for her artwork despite being one of the most influencial artists during the time period. Kusama's trauamtic childhood left her with mental illnesses she carries for the rest of her life, one of them being obsessive compulsive neurosis. She was able to channel her mental illness through her artwork, resulting in her famous polka-dotted artworks that allowed her to therapeutically work through her obsessions. It is important to note that during the 1960's when Kusama was creating artwork with such forward thinking themes and techniques, while she wasn't getting the recognition she deserved, other artists such as Andy Warhol, Lucas Samaras and Claes Oldenberg stole her ideas and got the credit and attention for them. In the art world, being a female minority was critisized at the time, but after finally be credited for her entrancing work, Yayoi Kusama is now the most expensive living female artist. Much deserved.</p>

        <!-- Christine Wang exclusive paragraph -->
        <p>This painting is called 'Americans' by Christine Wang from her exhibiton "Meme Girl" from March 2020. Christine Tien Wang has been recognized to be a Contemporary Pop Artists. Contemporary in this context means, present day, or modern. Wang can be considered a Contemporary Pop artist because of her ability to create oil paintings that are structured to be just like internet memes. This type of reflection of media and imagery truly has the essence what Pop Art truly means. It really is a modern take on the world as we currently know it. Many of Wang's paintings continue to have a meme structure to them, but they address many modern day topics that truly reflect society.</p>
