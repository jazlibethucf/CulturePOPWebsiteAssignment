        <!-- History paragraph -->
        <p>The POP Art movement was an art movement that began in the 1950's and lasted until the late 1960's early 1970's in America and Great Britain. Several well-known artists contributed to this movement including Andy Warhol (whose work can be seen above), Yayoi Kusama and Roy Lichtenstein. This movement began with young artists being taught the way art is traditionally created and how art properly looks from art school. This resulted in those young artist’s rejecting those traditionalist ideas and creating art with imagery that reflected society. One of the characteristics of Pop Art includes imagery that is recognizable such as music artists, celebrities, product packaging among other logos in the media. Another characteristic of Pop Art is innovative techniques are viewed as nontraditional when creating artworks such as printmaking. Printmaking enabled artists to produce images in large quantities which was a pioneering concept at the time. Andy Warhol is famous for his printmaking techniques and repetitive imagery as seen in his work above called Marilyn.

        <!-- Yayoi Kusama exlcusive paragraph -->
        <p>As previously mentioned, Yayoi Kusama is a well-known artist who heavily contributed to the Pop Art movement in the 1960's. At the time, being a single Japanese woman resulted in her facing racism, sexism, and a lack of overall recognition for her artwork despite being one of the most influential artists during the time period. Kusama's traumatic childhood left her with mental illnesses she has carried for her whole life, one of them being obsessive compulsive neurosis. She found that she was able to channel her mental illness through her artwork, resulting in her famous polka-dotted artworks that allowed her to therapeutically work through her obsessions. It is important to note that during the 1960's, Kusama was creating artwork with inventive thinking themes and techniques, but since she was not getting recognition for it, other artists such as Andy Warhol, Lucas Samaras and Claes Oldenburg stole her ideas and got the credit and attention for them. In the art world, being a female minority was criticized at the time and it wasn’t until year later that Yayoi Kusama was finally credited for her entrancing work. Now, Yayoi Kusama is now the most expensive living female artist and it is much deserved.</p>

        <!-- Christine Wang exclusive paragraph -->
        <p>This painting is called 'Americans' by Christine Wang from her exhibition "Meme Girl" from March 2020. Christine Tien Wang has been recognized to be a Contemporary Pop Artists. Contemporary in this context means, present day, or modern. Wang can be considered a Contemporary Pop artist because of her ability to create oil paintings that are structured to be just like internet memes. This type of reflection of media and imagery truly has the essence what Pop Art truly means. It really is a modern take on the world as we currently know it. Many of Wang's paintings continue to have a meme structure to them, but they address many modern day topics that truly reflect society.</p>
